Second latency. With robots becoming increasingly prominent in society, so too does the desire for them to solve complex multistage tasks increase. Okay. making a meal, while also considering how to physically execute each step, such as picking up an individual ingredient. As the whole number of steps potentially... Wait, what? As the number of steps and potential interactions a robot could make rises, the difficulty of the task rises exponentially. Current methods to solve these long horizon tasks fall largely into two campaigns. The first is motion planning based methods such as task and motion planning. These methods often require a human expert to manually specify certain conditions or difficult tasks. The second are policy-based methods such as behavioral tasks... wait, okay, RL. Behavioral cloning requires a tremendous amount of human demonstrations on each task, while it is costly and hard to scale. On the expert-written reward function which is difficult to... Lastly, many recent works investigating and visual language models, VLMs, have been leveraged to automatically generate reward functions and these models still struggle when presented with complex multi-step tasks. This raises an employee to perform long-horizon tasks and real- the semantics of natural language instruction, low-level skills, and a generalizable measure. We also emphasize limiting the amount of human... tasks.
